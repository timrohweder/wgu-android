# Android Course Scheduler App

- This is an Android app that allows scheduling terms and classes
- It was created for WGU's C196 class, Mobile Application Development
- It features basic CRUD operations for Terms, Courses, and Instructors
- The app allows the creation of notifications

## Getting Started

1. Enter the following into a console:\
   `git clone https://github.com/timrohweder/wgu-android.git your-directory`

2. Open Android Studio and select `Open Existing Android Studio Project`

3. Navigate to `your-directory` and open it

4. Make sure you have a debug-enabled device plugged in to your computer, or an emulator downloaded in Android Studio \
   https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator \
   https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device

5. Select a device from the dropdown menu in the toolbar if one is not already selected

6. Click the green run button in the toolbar, located next to the device dropdown menu

The app should now be running. Please note, if you are using an emulator it may take several minutes for it to load.

## Built With

- Android Studio
- Java
- Modern best practices, such as Room and AndroidX

## To Do

### Improve the UI

The specifications for this course required me to build, in what is my opinion, a non very intuitive UI. At a minimum, I would add quick links to the home page for adding terms and courses. I would also add the ability to create an assessment while creating a course.

### Add unit testing

Testing was not required for this project. I would certainly add tests before submitting it to the Google Play store.
